# Beyonder Abilities Design

Jiapei Chen

## Tyrant Path

### Sequence 7, Seafarer, Water Ball

Convert a nearby water tile into a water ball and make it spin around the player

Shoot the water ball to an enemy.

Possible settings:

1. Manual Mode or Auto Mode?

2. Target? (The nearest enemy? The enemy with the least amount of health? The enemy with the least portion of health? The enemy who deals the most damage?...)

## How to arrange ability usage when there are dozens of different abilities that a player can use?

I need to do some research.

Design 1: Set a button (for example "Z"). If you press button "Z", You will enter Beyonder Abilities Mode. You can use certain abilities by pressing keys you set without triggering other effect in Terraria.

Design 2: Set a list of beyonder abilities, put them in a UI interface (at the middle top of the screen, maybe) Press key "Z" to scroll leftward and key "X" to scroll rightward. Press key C to trigger the beyonder ability.
