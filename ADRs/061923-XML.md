Status: accepted

Deciders: Jiapei Chen

## Context and Problem Statement

What documentation generator should I use?

## Considered Options

XML

AsciiDoc

MarkDown

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: XML. Because it was first recommended by both ChatGPT and many other sources on Internet. I can be semi-autogenerated through extensions on VS Code.

## Consequences

I am still working on XML comments. I want to add "author" and "date" attributes to each comment but it haven't been achieved yet. (2023-6-19)
